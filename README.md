# random-language-picker
This program will randomly choose a programming language out of a list of languages. Basically it just picks a random line out of a text file.


To use it fill the text file with languages you know and languages you want to learn. Then when you have an idea of what to build, just run the program and it will return one of the languages. This is important because it allows you to maintain your skills in each programming language by practicing with practical applications.

To run the program, just type:

./pickLang.py

or

python3 pickLang.py


By appending "add" after the file name and then giving the language to add, it will automatically write the language into the file.

Enjoy!
